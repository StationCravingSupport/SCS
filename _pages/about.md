## Our story

(All prices correct January 2026)

SCS was founded by two station-snackers like you. We will call them Margaret and Benjamin to maintain their anonymity and out of respect for their commute. Margaret started off on vending machines. Crinkled cut paprika crisps spoke out to her on the platform. It was £1.40 a pack. She ate them too quickly and dealt with light indigestion that evening. Margaret understood how bad station-snacking was. This didn't help her stop. This didn't make it any easier. She was tired, it was dark, and she was all alone on these commutes. The vending machine was bright, it interacted with her, it was keen for her attention when nothing else was.

A few weeks later Margaret had moved on to M&S, now it was £2.10 packet. The price was 50% higher than the vending machine, Margaret told herself, but she was getting 3.75 times the crisps. It was a no-brainer, she thought. She couldn't bear to consider how much more indigestion these additional crisps would give her, how her appetite for a hearty dinner wouldn't be quite the same. She blamed herself for not being perfect.

Soon, Margaret was spreading her bad habits. On one of her good days, Margaret bought an apple from M&S, Benjamin just thought why not buy a 6-pack of apples from a different shop. A few days later it was a packet of crisps, a chocolate bar, some poppadoms. Then Benjamin was purchasing some cold, processed meats (£4.50). Margaret stopped Benjamin as he approached the self-checkout, showing him that M&S had a three for £8 deal on these processed meats. A few minutes later they were feasting at the station, the vending machine laying dormant. Benjamin was polishing off these processed meats for dinner two days running. Suddenly, Benjamin was hooked.
